# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# FitOS: Multi-Tenant Fitness Platform

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
FitOS

### 1.2 Purpose
FitOS is a multi-tenant fitness platform with an iOS mobile application designed to help users get into shape and stay on track with their fitness goals. It leverages AI to provide personalized workouts, diet plans, nutrition tracking, and real-time feedback, using iPhone camera and sensor capabilities while offering enterprise-ready tenant management.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Fitness enthusiasts (beginners to advanced)
- Individuals seeking weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance
- Ages 18–45, primarily iOS users

### 1.4 Objectives
- Increase user adherence to fitness routines through curated, AI-driven content.
- Provide accurate tracking of workouts and nutrition via camera and sensor integration.
- Deliver an engaging, intuitive iOS experience with SwiftUI.

## 2. Features and Functionality

### 2.1 User Onboarding
- **Description**: New users create an account and input fitness details; existing users log in securely.
- **Requirements**:
  - Sign-up form: Email, password, height, weight, fitness goal (e.g., "Lose Weight," "Build Muscle," "Maintain").
  - Login with email/password.
  - Data stored in PostgreSQL via Azure APIs.
- **Success Criteria**: 95% of users complete onboarding in under 2 minutes.

### 2.2 Workout Tracking
- **Description**: Users record workouts using the iPhone camera and sensors, receiving real-time AI feedback.
- **Requirements**:
  - Camera integration (AVFoundation) for video recording.
  - Sensor integration (CoreMotion) for motion data (e.g., reps, posture).
  - Azure API streams data to AWS Lambda + SageMaker for AI analysis (e.g., rep counting, posture tips).
  - Feedback displayed in SwiftUI (e.g., "10 reps, adjust elbows").
  - Workout history view with date, duration, reps, and feedback.
- **Success Criteria**: AI feedback accuracy ≥ 85%; history loads in < 2 seconds.

### 2.3 Meal and Nutrition Tracking
- **Description**: Users snap meal photos to log calories and nutrients, tracking daily intake against goals.
- **Requirements**:
  - SwiftUI camera interface for meal snapshots.
  - Images uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
  - AWS Lambda + SageMaker analyzes images for calories and nutrients (e.g., protein, carbs, fats).
  - Dashboard shows daily intake vs. calorie goal.
  - Data saved in PostgreSQL.
- **Success Criteria**: Calorie estimates within 10% of actual; dashboard updates in real-time.

### 2.4 Curated Content
- **Description**: Users access AI-generated diet plans and training videos for guided fitness.
- **Requirements**:
  - Training video library (stored in Azure Blob Storage) with categories (e.g., Cardio, Strength).
  - SwiftUI video player for seamless playback.
  - AI-generated diet plans (via Azure Functions) based on user goal, weight, and activity level.
  - Plans include daily calorie goals and nutrition breakdown (e.g., 40% carbs, 30% protein).
- **Success Criteria**: 90% of users engage with videos weekly; diet plans generated in < 5 seconds.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend
- Platform: iOS (version 16.0+)
- Framework: SwiftUI
- Features: Camera (AVFoundation), sensors (CoreMotion), responsive UI.

### 3.2 Backend
- **Services**:
  - Azure App Service: Hosts RESTful APIs for auth, workout, and meal data.
  - AWS Lambda + SageMaker: Processes AI tasks (workout feedback, meal analysis).
  - Azure Functions: Generates diet plans.
- **Storage**:
  - Azure Blob Storage: Stores videos and meal images.
  - PostgreSQL (Azure DB): Stores user, workout, meal, and diet data.

### 3.3 Data Model
- User: userId, email, passwordHash, height, weight, goal.
- Workout: workoutId, userId, date, duration, reps, feedback, videoUrl.
- Meal: mealId, userId, date, imageUrl, calories, nutrients (JSONB).
- Diet: dietId, userId, startDate, calorieGoal, nutritionPlan (JSONB).
- TrainingVideo: videoId, title, url, category.

### 3.4 Performance
- API response time: < 500ms (excluding AI processing).
- AI analysis: < 2 seconds for workout feedback, < 5 seconds for meal analysis.
- App launch time: < 3 seconds.

### 3.5 Security
- Passwords hashed (e.g., bcrypt).
- API authentication via JWT tokens.
- Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (Azure/AWS encryption).

## 4. User Experience (UX)

### 4.1 Key Screens
- Welcome: Sign-up/login options.
- Profile: Edit fitness details, view progress.
- Workout: Start recording, real-time feedback overlay, history list.
- Meal: Camera snap, nutrient breakdown, daily dashboard.
- Content: Video library, diet plan view.

### 4.2 Design Principles
- Intuitive navigation (SwiftUI tab bar).
- Real-time feedback for engagement.
- Clean, fitness-inspired aesthetic (e.g., bold colors, clear metrics).

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions:
- Users have iPhones with cameras and motion sensors (iPhone 8+ recommended).
- Internet connection required for AI features and content.

### Constraints:
- iOS-only initially; Android migration planned later.
- AI model training data (workouts, meals) must be sourced or created.

## 6. Milestones and Timeline
- MVP Delivery: May 9, 2025 (end of Sprint 4).
- Sprints (2 weeks each, starting March 17, 2025):
  1. User onboarding.
  2. Workout tracking with camera.
  3. Meal tracking with AI.
  4. Curated content and diets.

## 7. Success Metrics
- Adoption: 1,000 active users within 3 months of launch.
- Engagement: 70% of users log workouts or meals weekly.
- Retention: 60% user retention after 30 days.
- Accuracy: AI feedback and calorie estimates meet success criteria.

## 8. Open Questions
- What's the app's name/branding?
- Any specific AI models or APIs preferred (e.g., Azure Cognitive Services vs. SageMaker)?
- Budget or team size constraints?
